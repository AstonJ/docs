# Contributing

You want to contribute?  Great!  Thanks for being awesome!  At the moment, we have a big internal todo list, hop on https://gitter.im/voltrb/volt so we don't duplicate work.  Pull requests are always welcome, but asking about helping on gitter should save some duplication.

Any doc changes should be updated in our [gitbook repo](https://github.com/voltrb/docs).

## Running tests

Run both Ruby and Opal specs:

```console
$ bundle exec rake
```

Run integration tests:

```console

```
