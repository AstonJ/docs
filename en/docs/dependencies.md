## Dependencies

You can also use controls (see below) from one component in another.  To do this, you must require the component from the component you wish to use them in.  This can be done in the ```config/dependencies.rb``` file.  Just put

```ruby
    component 'component_name'
```

in the file.

Dependencies act just like require in ruby, but for whole components.

Sometimes you may need to include an externally hosted JS file from a component.  To do this, simply do the following in the dependencies.rb file:

```ruby
    javascript_file 'http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js'
    css_file '//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.3/css/bootstrap.min.css'
```

Note above though that jquery and bootstrap are currently included by default.  Using javascript_file and css_file will be mixed in with your component assets at the correct locations according to the order they occur in the dependencies.rb files.
