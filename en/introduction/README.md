# Goals

Volt has the following goals:

1. Developer happiness
2. Sharing of code between the client and server
3. Automatic data syncing between client and server
4. Apps are built as nested components.  Components can be shared (via gems)
5. Concurrent.  Volt provides tools to simplify concurrency.  Component rendering is done in parallel on the server
6. Intelligent asset management
7. Secure (shouldn't need to be said, but it does)
8. Fast, light, and scalable
9. Understandable code base
10. Upgradeability

# Road Map

Many of the core Volt features are implemented.  We still have a bit to go before 1.0, most of it involving models.

1. Model read/write permissions
2. User accounts, user collection, signup/login templates
